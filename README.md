# GoodbyeDPI - Quick, Startup and Invisible

This script runs GoodbyeDPI once and makes it a startup application so you don't have to run it every time. It also runs invisibly in the background so you won't see it in your taskbar.

## What does it do?

GoodbyeDPI is a lightweight tool designed to bypass DPI (Deep Packet Inspection) used by internet service providers to block access to certain websites. It works by modifying packet data in a way that prevents DPI systems from correctly identifying and filtering connections, allowing users to access blocked content more freely without a VPN. Itâ€™s popular among users in countries with restricted internet access, providing a straightforward and efficient solution to regain access to censored sites.

## Installation

First of all, put this script in a place where you will not change its location in the future. Because the script will be run on every startup. If you change the file location, you can run `install.bat` again.

Then run `install.bat`. That's it! This script will add GoodbyeDPI as a startup application so you don't have to run it every time. It will also run invisibly in the background.
